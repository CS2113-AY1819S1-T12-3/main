== Introduction

JalilEnterprises is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for stock taking*. More importantly, JalilEnterprises is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, JalilEnterprises can get your stock management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Stock List.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/Arduino q/20 m/5 t/Lab1 t/Lab2` : adds 20 `Arduino` item to the StockList, with tags `Lab1` and `Lab2`.
* **`delete`**`n/Arduino q/20` : delete `20 Arduinos`.
* *`status`* : Shows the number of every item in each status category (Free, loan, faulty)

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in UPPER_CASE are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in add n/NAME, NAME is a parameter which can be used as add n/Arduino.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g n/NAME [t/TAG] can be used as n/Arduino t/Lab1 or as n/Arduino.
* Items with …​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. [t/TAG]…​ can be used as   (i.e. 0 times), t/Lab1, t/Lab2 t/Lab 5 etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies n/NAME q/QUANTITY, q/QUANTITY n/NAME is also acceptable.
====

=== Viewing help : `help`

Format: `help`

=== Adding an item: `add`

Adds an item to the stock list +
Format: `add n/NAME q/QUANTITY m/MINIMUM_QUANTITY [t/TAG]`



Examples:

* `add n/Arduino q/20 m/5 t/Lab1 t/Lab2`


=== Updating an item : `update`

Updates an existing item in the stock list +
Format: `update n/NAME [q/QUANTITY] [m/MINIMUM_QUANTITY] [t/TAG]`

****
* Updates the item with the specified name.
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the item will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the item’s tags by typing t/ without specifying any tags after it.
****
Examples:

* `update n/Arduino q/25 t/Lab7 t/Lab8` +
Edits the quantity and tags of the Arduino item to be `25` and `Lab7`, `Lab8` respectively.

=== Deleting an item : `delete`

Deletes an item from the stock list +
Format: `delete n/NAME q/QUANTITY`
Examples:

* `delete n/Arduino q/20` +
Deletes 20 Arduinos

=== Listing all items : `all`
Shows all items in the stock list +
Format: `all`


=== Locating items by name: `find`

Finds items whose names contain any of the given keywords. +
Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `arduino` will match `Arduino`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `ESP8226 Chip` will match `Chip ESP8266`
* Only the name is searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Arduino` will not match `Arduinos`
* Items matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `Arduino Uno` will return `Arduino Mega`, `Arduino Leonardo`
****

Examples:

* `find Arduino` +
Returns `Arduino` and `Arduino Uno`
* `find Arduino Pi` +
Returns any items having names `Arduino` or `Pi`

=== Listing item status: `status`

Shows the number of every item in each status category (Free, loan, faulty) +
Format: `status`

=== Changing status of item: `changeStatus`

The status of the items can be changed +
Format: `changeStatus n/NAME q/QUANTITY s/status`

Examples:

* `changeStatus n/Arduino q/20 s/faulty` +
The status of 20 arduinos would be changed to faulty

=== Creating a loan list: `loanList`
A loan list can be created whenever a list of items loaned out needs to be kept tracked on +
Format: `loanList n/NAME q/QUANTITY l/LOANER`
Examples:

* `loanList n/Arduino q/20 l/KinWhye` +
This would update the status of the 20 arduinos to loan

=== Listing entered commands : `history`

Lists all the commands that you have entered in reverse chronological order. +
Format: `history`

[NOTE]
====
Pressing the kbd:[&uarr;] and kbd:[&darr;] arrows will display the previous and next input respectively in the command box.
====

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undoing previous command : `undo`

Restores the address book to the state before the previous _undoable_ command was executed. +
Format: `undo`

[NOTE]
====
Undoable commands: those commands that modify the address book's content (`add`, `delete`, `edit` and `clear`).
====

Examples:

* `delete 1` +
`list` +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +

* `select 1` +
`list` +
`undo` +
The `undo` command fails as there are no undoable commands executed previously.

* `delete 1` +
`clear` +
`undo` (reverses the `clear` command) +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +

=== Redoing the previously undone command : `redo`

Format: `redo`

Examples:

* `delete 1` +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +
`redo` (reapplies the `delete 1` command) +

* `delete 1` +

// end::undoredo[]

// tag::savecommand[]
=== Save current version of stock list : `save`
An xml file recording current stocks will be created and named. +
