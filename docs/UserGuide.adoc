== Introduction

JalilEnterprises is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for stock taking*. More importantly, JalilEnterprises is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, JalilEnterprises can get your stock management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `JalilEnterprises.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Stock List.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  You should log into this app via the *`login`* command before you start to use it. +
However, in v1.3, the login function is a stub and the app can still be used without logging in. +
Example of how to log in:
* **`login`**`u/admin p/admin`

.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all items
* **`add`**`n/Arduino q/20 m/5 t/Lab1 t/Lab2` : adds 20 `Arduino` item to the StockList, with a minimum quantity of 5 and tags `Lab1` and `Lab2`
* **`delete`**`1` : deletes the item with index 1
* *`status`* : Shows the number of every item in each status category (Ready, On_Loan, Faulty)

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/Arduino`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]`` can be used as `n/Arduino t/Lab1` or as `n/Arduino`.
* Items with `…​` after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/Lab1`, `t/Lab2 t/Lab5` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME q/QUANTITY`, `q/QUANTITY n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====

=== Editing an item : `edit`

Edits an existing item in the stock list +
Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [q/QUANTITY] [m/MINIMUM_QUANTITY] [t/TAG]`

****
* Edits the person at the specified INDEX. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list. The index must be a positive integer 1, 2, 3, …​
* At least one of the fields (name, quantity, minimum quantity or tag) must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
