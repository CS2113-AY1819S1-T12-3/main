== Introduction

JalilEnterprises is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for stock taking*. More importantly, JalilEnterprises is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, JalilEnterprises can get your stock management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `JalilEnterprises.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Stock List.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  You should log into this app via the *`login`* command before you start to use it. +
Example of how to log in:
* **`login`**`u/jalil p/dontworrybrother`

.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all items
* **`add`**`n/Arduino q/20 m/5 t/Lab1 t/Lab2` : adds 20 `Arduino` item to the StockList, with a minimum quantity of 5 and tags `Lab1` and `Lab2`.
* **`delete`**`1 q/20` : decreases the quantity of the `1st item by 20`.
* *`status`* : Shows the number of every item in each status category (Ready, On_Loan, Faulty)

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/Arduino`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]`` can be used as `n/Arduino t/Lab1` or as `n/Arduino`.
* Items with `…​` after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/Lab1`, `t/Lab2 t/Lab5` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME q/QUANTITY`, `q/QUANTITY n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====

=== Viewing help : `help`

Format: `help`

=== Adding an item: `add`

Adds an item to the stock list +
Format: `add n/NAME q/QUANTITY m/MINIMUM_QUANTITY [t/TAG]`



Examples:

* `add n/Arduino q/20 m/5 t/Lab1 t/Lab2`


=== Updating an item : `update`

Updates an existing item in the stock list +
Format: `update INDEX n/NAME [q/QUANTITY] [m/MINIMUM_QUANTITY] [t/TAG]`

****
* Edits the person at the specified INDEX. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list. The index must be a positive integer 1, 2, 3, …​
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the item will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the item’s tags by typing t/ without specifying any tags after it.
****
Examples:

* `update 1 n/Arduino q/25 t/Lab7 t/Lab8` +
Edits the name, quantity and tags of the 1st item to be `Arduino`, `25` and `Lab7`, `Lab8` respectively.

=== Deleting an item : `delete`

Deletes an item from the stock list +
Format: `delete INDEX q/QUANTITY`

Examples:

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `arduino` will match `Arduino`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `ESP8226 Chip` will match `Chip ESP8266`
* Only the name is searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Arduino` will not match `Arduinos`
* Items matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `Arduino Uno` will return `Arduino Mega`, `Arduino Leonardo`
****

Examples:

* `find Arduino` +
