== PROJECT: Jalil Enterprises Stock List

---

== Overview

JalilEnterprises StockList is a stock managing application used for accounting for the equipment in the Computer Engineering labs in NUS. The app was developed by my team, JalilEnterprises. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 11 kLoC. My role in the team was to improve the app’s security, and I accomplished this by creating a login feature with account management. This portfolio serves to document my role and contributions to the project.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added a *login/logout feature*
** What it does: allows the user to log in and log out with an account registered on the app.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly with regards to security, because sensitive information will be stored with regards to the equipment in the labs and the authorised user should be able to control who has access to this app.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects the usability of the app as a whole. Users are not allowed to modify the inventory until they have logged in. This required an in-depth analysis of how the app processes the commands and storage files. The implementation was also challenging as it required changes that touched a lot of aspects of the app.
** Credits: _AddressBook-Level4 by se-edu for the base app which we could morph and improve on._

* *Minor enhancement*: added an *account management feature*, which allows for:
** Adding accounts
** Editing accounts
** Deleting accounts
** Listing registered accounts
** Finding a registered account
** Resetting the registered accounts to default
** Checking current login status of the account

* *Code contributed*: https://nuscs2113-ay1819s1.github.io/dashboard/#=undefined&search=davindran[Project Code Dashboard]

* *Other contributions*:

** Project management:
*** Managed releases `v1.1` - `v1.4rc` (4 releases) on GitHub
** Enhancements to existing features:
***	Contributed in morphing the AddressBook across the board to StockList
***	Contributed in morphing test cases from that of AddressBook to StockList
** Documentation:
*** Morphed the Developer Guide from AddressBook into one tailored for our StockList: https://github.com[#13]
** Community:
*** PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments): https://github.com[#96], https://github.com[#97]
*** Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class
** Tools:
*** Integrated a new Github plugin (TravisCI) to the team repo


== Contributions to the User Guide


|===
|_Given below are sections I contributed to the User Guide. They showcase my ability to write documentation targeting end-users._
|===

// tag::login[]
=== List registered accounts: `listAccounts`

Lists all the accounts currently registered in StockList. +
Format: `listAccounts`

=== Find a registered account: `findAccount`

Finds a registered account whose names contain any of the given keywords. +
Format: `findAccount KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `admin` will match `Admin`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `admin jalil` will match `jalil admin`
* Only the name is searched.
* Partial words will be matched e.g. `ad` will match `admin`
* Items matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `admin jalil` will return `admin tan`, `admin lee`
****

Examples:

* `findAccount admin` +
Returns `admin` and `Admin Jalil`
* `findAccount admin tom` +
Returns any items having names `admin` or `tom`

=== Logging in: `login`

Logs into Stock List. +
Format: `login u/USERNAME p/PASSWORD`

Examples:

* `login u/admin p/admin`

=== Checking login status: `loginStatus`

Checks login status of Stock List. +
Format: `loginStatus`
// end::login[]

// tag::accountManagement[]
=== Adding an account: `addAccount`

Adds an account to the database. +
Format: `addAccount u/USERNAME p/PASSWORD`

Examples:

* `addAccount u/john p/doe`
* `addAccount u/jalil p/boss123`

=== Deleting an account: `deleteAccount`

Deletes an account from the database. +
Format: `delete INDEX` +

Index can be found using `listAccounts`

Examples:

* `deleteAccount 2` +
Deletes the second account in the database, according to the index via `listAccounts`.

NOTE: It is strongly NOT recommended to delete the first account i.e. the admin account.


=== Editing an account currently in the database: `editAccount`

Edits a registered account in the database. +
Format: `edit INDEX u/USERNAME [p/PASSWORD]`

****
* Edits the account at the specified INDEX. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed list when 'listAccounts' is used. The index must be a positive integer 1, 2, 3, …​
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing credentials will be updated to the input credentials.
****
Examples:

* `editAccount 2 p/password123!` +
Changes the password of the second account to `password123!`

NOTE: Exercise caution when editing the admin account.

=== Resetting the account database: `resetAccounts`

Resets the account database. +
All accounts will be deleted and a default admin account will be created. +
Credentials of the default account: `u/admin p/admin`

Format: `resetAccounts`

=== Logging out: `logout`

Logs out of Stock List. +
Format: `logout`
// end::accountManagement[]

=== Login feature
==== Current Implementation

The login mechanism is facilitated by `LoginCommand`. It extends `Command` and implements the following operations:


* `LoginCommand#modifyLoginStatus()` -- checks if the password matches the account in the database, if it exists. If true, updates the logged in account status in `Model` accordingly.

* `LoginCommand#execute()` -- calls `LoginCommand#modifyLoginStatus()`. Then, checks login status in `Model` and displays a login success message if true and displays a failure message otherwise.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#setLoggedInUser()` and `Model#getLoginStatus()` respectively.


Given below is an example usage scenario and how the LoginCommand mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `login u/admin p/admin` command to log into StockList with *admin* and *admin* being the username and password credentials respectively.

Step 2. The `execute` command calls `Model#getLoginStatus()` and checks if the user is already logged in. If true, `execute` throws a `CommandException` notifying the user that he is already logged in.

Step 3. The `execute` command then calls `LoginCommand#modifyLoginStatus()`, which checks if the username *admin* exists in the account list, and if it does, checks if the given password *admin* matches the password associated with the username *admin*.

Step 4. If the *admin* password matches, `LoginCommand#modifyLoginStatus()` calls `Model#setLoggedInUser()` which updates the logged in account status in `model` with the logged in account set to *admin* and logged in status set to true.

Step 5. The `execute` command then checks the log in status via `Model#getLoginStatus()`. A success message is printed if true; otherwise a failure message is printed.

The following sequence diagram shows how the login operation works:

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How login executes

* **Alternative 1** (current choice) Check against various accounts stored in a file and allow access if match.
** Pros: Allows for multiple accounts with access to StockList.
** Cons: More memory usage.

* **Alternative 2** Checks against a single account that can be modified.
** Pros: Simple to implement, minimal memory usage, allows for only one access account.
** Cons: Does not allow access for multiple accounts, locked out of app if credentials lost.
